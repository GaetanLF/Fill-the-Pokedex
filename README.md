# Fill the Pokedex : how to perform a simple web scrapping using Pokemon data
### Authors : GaÃ«tan LE FLOCH, Lucas PRUTKI, Alexis VIGNARD

This project aims to complete a so-called "Pokedex" using available data on pokedex.org. We begin with a small database containing names, HPs, types ect. and we add informations such as height, weight, catch rate and hatch steps.

Nonetheless, our Pokedex still stays light as we could have taken much more data about gender ratio, evolution levels, natural moves' levels ect.. We've decided not to take it as this shouldn't be relevant for our original task (which was to make some dataviz about pokemons within the framework of our Python assignment at Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne University).
