##### Description

This project aims to complete a so-called "Pokedex" using available data on pokedex.org. We begin with a small database containing names, HPs, types ect. and we add informations such as height, weight, catch rate and hatch steps.

Nonetheless, our Pokedex still stays light as we could have taken much more data about gender ratio, evolution levels, natural moves' levels ect.. We've decided not to take it as this shouldn't be relevant for our original task (which was to make some dataviz about pokemons within the framework of our Python assignment at Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne University).

##### Requirements

Since pokedex.org is a dynamic website, you will need to install the selenium package (which should be already available if you have Anaconda). You should also need an appropriate driver for your web browser which are all available on https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/ if you are using a regular browser. Mozilla Firefox users like me could take a look at the Github repository for GeckoDriver : https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
